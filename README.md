In This Poject I made Flappy Bird using C++ Language and SFML Framework library.
I Started Making this project only for fun.

Flappy Bird is an endless game that involves a bird that the player can control.
The player has to save the bird from colliding with the hurdles like pipes.
Each time the bird passes through the pipes, the score gets incremented by one. 
The game ends when the bird collides with the pipes or falls down due to gravity.
